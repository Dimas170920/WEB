      <h2 >History of company creation</h2>
     	
      		<div >
      			
      			<p>The story began in 1983 when two Ukrainian scientists <span>Pavel Kozlemenko</span> and <span>Andrey Senabruk</span> wrote the program which was called <strong><q>Luxer</q></strong>. Сomputers were themselves understand which by the way here is one of them:<img src="Lab1/old_pc.jpg" alt="First company PC" class = "img-responsive img-left" width="600px" > The company name originates from this program. Over time, OS support programs grew and the number of programs increased with the number of employees and LLA(Luxe Life Admin) was founded in 1990. In the beginning we had nothing but the desire to create and the desire to make the world feel better and more perfect for so much strength. Initially, the company had 100 employees, today we employ more than 50 thousand employees, we started from a small office on the outskirts of Kiev and now we have dozens of offices in different countries of the world.We work with various global companies such as Microsoft, Apple,Xiaomi,Lenovo,Dell and many others.The company focuses its resources on writing programs but diagnostics is also our profile. There were hard times in 1995, the company was on the verge of bankruptcy due to rapidly developing competitors, but thanks to the reputation and loyal employees who worked a couple of months without a normal salary and did not leave the company, we were able not only to return to the previous level.</p>
      			<p>Our strategy is not based on making millions of dollars. The best result of our work will be the many installed programs on your devices and your positive feedback. Creating a company was not an easy decision but it is 100% worth it, because how many people have we helped and it all helps us move forward. We are working to improve our lives!</p>
